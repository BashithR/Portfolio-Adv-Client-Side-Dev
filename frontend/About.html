          <h1>here's a story that will inspire you...</h1>
          <p>
            Back in primary school, I wasn’t much of an athlete. I wasn’t a top
            student either. I was just trying to keep up—struggling with my
            studies, hoping to improve. I didn’t stand out, and honestly, I
            didn’t know if I ever would.
            <br /><br />
            But I had one thing that made a difference: my best friend. He was
            the class topper—smart, kind, and someone who always seemed to know
            what to do. He didn’t just help me with schoolwork; he believed in
            me. He called me his best friend, and that meant something. We stuck
            together through everything—good days, bad days, exams, failures.
            That friendship was real.
            <br /><br />
            Little by little, I started catching up. People noticed. I moved up
            in class rankings, eventually becoming third. He was still first,
            but I was right there behind him. For the first time, I felt like I
            was doing something right.
            <br /><br />
            Then he left the school—
            <br /><br />
            Before he left, he told me, <i>“You’ll take my place.”</i> I didn’t
            know if I could—but I tried. And I did. I became first in class.
            That moment wasn’t just about being the best—it was about proving to
            myself that I could be good at something. That I mattered.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned...</h3>
          <p id="learnt-lesson">
            Growth isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being persistent.
            <br />
            <br />
            Friendship can be the most powerful form of mentorship.
            <br />
            <br />
            Belief—whether it’s yours or someone else’s—can push you forward.
            <br />
            <br />
            Success feels sweeter when it’s shared.
            <br />
          </p>

          <h3>The Message I Carry Forward...</h3>
          <p>
            I’m not sharing this to brag. I’m sharing it because someone out
            there might feel the way I did—average, stuck, unsure. If that’s
            you, find people who lift you up. Stick with them. Let them help you
            grow. And when it’s your turn, do the same for someone else.
